# Solitaire Accordion Game
#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/Q7MdRNa1UWk>
#### Description:
Solitaire Accordion is a card solitaire (patience) that uses a single deck of 52 cards. Its name was given because it looks like accordion pleats, which are compressed into a pile while playing it. The objective is to compress the entire deck into one pile, just like an accordion.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: Python installed and a Terminal application to run the game. Therefore, it is prefereable to be played in a computer, however it can be played also in websites that can run Python code and display it.

Therefore, this project adapts the idea of the Solitaire Accordion into a command-line game using Python. It also uses the `random` library from Python to make each game unique on its own. Also, this project takes advantage of the suit symbols, that are avaible via ascii.

I decided to choose a command-line game, because I thought it was the cleaner way to implement the Solitaire Accordion's logic, with no other distractions to keep you from enjoy this great puzzle. Also, making easier for those who are attempting to play and win it. Since it is very hard to be confused by the position of the cards or their ranks/suits.

It is also important to address that not all the times you play it are winnable. And also note that, the odds of winning the Solitaire Accordion have been estimated as 1 in 100. So, you probably think it's very hard. But it is very rewarding to end the game with a sucess message popping up on the screen. But don't be sad, because Alfred Sheinwold suggests in his book 101 Best Family Card Games (ISBN 0-8069-8635-2) that you can considere a win when the game ends at 5 piles or fewer. *data from Solitaire Accordion's Wikipedia*

My tip for a good gameplay comes by identifying 4 close cards from same rank, prefeareably near the end of the layout, by the start of the game, and to try conserve them together in a group without covering them with other cards, until the end of the game. *data from Solitaire Accordion's Wikipedia*

I decided to choose the Python language, because I was already familiar with it, but wanted to write a masterpiece on it, applying all I have learnt until this moment. A great tribute for this simple and straightforward language. I definitively love Python :)

So, there are 3 files in this game directory. Of course, the 1st is the `README.md` file. The 2nd one is the `assets.py`, which is responsible for containing the source code for the tool functions (ones that can be used multiples times during the game and contain a generic and straightforward purpose for the Solitaire Accordion). The 3rd file is `solitaire_accordion.py`, like the name says, it is the main file on this folder and contains the game loop, implementing all the core functionalities of the Solitaire Accordion, like game instructions, printing deck, asking for what card to stack, etc.

I hope you enjoy your time playing this awesome game!

I would also like to address that this CS50 final project is also a passion project for me, because, since I was little (5 or 6 years old), I always liked little puzzles. They were a way for me to escape from my reality. And a favorite of mine was Solitaire. More specifically, the Accordion one. Playing it is something so smooth and simply fun!
